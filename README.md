# VTFLib - A Valve VTF and VMT image format programming library.

VTFLib is a LGPL open source programming library that provides a C and C++ API that, with a few simple functions, can open and save .vtf and .vmt files, providing access to all known features. The library functions independent of Steam, allowing third party applications to use the library without Steam present or runningi on the target system.

VTFLib includes two GPL example applications, VTFCmd and VTFEdit. VTFCmd is a C command line frontend for VTFLib that can create .vtf and .vmt files from various source formats. It is similar in functionality to Valve's vtex Source SDK utility, but offers a lot more control. VTFEdit is a C++ .NET graphical frontend for VTFLib with viewing and creation capabilities. Both VTFCmd and VTFEdit support several source image formats, including, but not limited to .bmp, .dds, .gif, .jpg, .png and .tga.

## A note from the authors

Between 2005 and 2011 myself and Ryan Gregg developed a number of tools and libraries to help modders and developers create content for Valve's Source game engine - VTFLib was one of them. However, as of time of writing, that was 12 years ago and we've moved onto other things. I'm shocked (and actually pleased) that people are still using VTFLib and VTFEdit despite how old it is.

Though we're not actively developing it, your welcome to make forks and develop your own version (maybe fix a few things) as per the LGPL license. I may *tinker* with the code from time to time though this is for my own curiosity and amusement and not any for of official work.

Thanks to everyone who supported us over the years!

## Project Structure

The library contains five folders:

* **Bin** - Contains library and example program binaries.
* **Lib** - Contains library C and C++ Header and Inline Files.
* **Sln** - Contains Visual Studio solutions.
* **VTFCmd** - Contains C example program source code.
* **VTFEdit** - Contains C++ .NET example program source code.
* **VTFLib** - Contains C++ library source code.

The project files are for Visual Studio .NET 2003 and 2005; no .NET extensions are used except in VTFEdit. Visual Studio 6.0 project files have also been
included, but nvDXTLib does not come with the correct .lib files to link with. nvDXTLib is required for VTF creation and can be downloaded from:
